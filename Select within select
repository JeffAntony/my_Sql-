 1. List each country name where the population is larger than that of 'Russia'.

world(name, continent, area, population, gdp)

SELECT name FROM world
  WHERE population >
     (SELECT population FROM world
      WHERE name='Russia');



Richer than UK
2.
Show the countries in Europe with a per capita GDP greater than 'United Kingdom'.

Per Capita GDP

select name from world where gdp>(select name from world  where name='United Kingdom');


3.

List the name and continent of countries in the continents containing either Argentina or Australia. Order by name of the country.


select name ,continent from world where continent in ( select continent  from world where name='Argentina' or name= 'Australia') order by name;


4.
Which country has a population that is more than United Kingdom but less than Germany? Show the name and the population.


select name,population from world where population >(select population from world where name= 'United Kingdom ') and population< (select population from world where name='Germany');

Bigger than every country in Europe
6.
Which countries have a GDP greater than every country in Europe? [Give the name only.] (Some countries may have NULL gdp values)


select name from world where gdp>(select max(gdp) from  world where continent='europe' and gdp is not null);

We can refer to values in the outer SELECT within the inner SELECT. We can name the tables so that we can tell the difference between the inner and outer versions.

Largest in each continent
7.
Find the largest country (by area) in each continent, show the continent, the name and the area:

The above example is known as a correlated or synchronized sub-query.

Using correlated subqueries
SELECT continent, name, area FROM world x
  WHERE  area>= ALL
    (SELECT area FROM world y
        WHERE y.continent=x.continent
          AND area>0);


8.
List each continent and the name of the country that comes first alphabetically.


SELECT continent, MIN(name) AS first_alphabetical_country
FROM world
GROUP BY continent;



9.
Find the continents where all countries have a population <= 25000000. Then find the names of the countries associated with these continents. Show name, continent and population.


select continent from world where country (select country from world where population<=25000000);
